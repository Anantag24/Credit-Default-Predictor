Credit Risk Modeling

This project focuses on developing a credit scoring model to predict the creditworthiness of individuals or companies. The goal is to identify "risky" versus "safe" borrowers based on historical financial and behavioral data.

 üìå Objective

To build a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of default using features such as:

- Loan repayment history
- Income and employment details
- Credit utilization patterns
- Other financial indicators

 üß† Approach

- Applied classification models such as **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Trees**
- Engineered relevant financial features for better risk segmentation
- Balanced class distribution using **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling)
- Evaluated model performance using **AUC-ROC**, **F1-score**, and **confusion matrix**

‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies

- Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Imbalanced-learn (for SMOTE)

üìä Key Skills Demonstrated

- Logistic Regression & Decision Trees
- Credit Scoring & Risk Classification
- Model Evaluation Techniques
- Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
